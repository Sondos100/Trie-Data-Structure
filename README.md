# Trie-Data-Structure
This project implements a **Trie (Prefix Tree)** in C++ to efficiently handle word storage, retrieval, and prefix-based operations.   It was developed as part of the **FuzeTek Summer Internship (Project 4)** to apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, algorithm design, and data structure implementation in a practical project.
